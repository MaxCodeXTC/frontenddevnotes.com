          <h2>1 : Basic overview of client-side application/website state</h2>

          <section class="sub">
            <p>
              Overview of the meaning of state in the context of websites and
              web applications loaded into a web client (e.g. a web browser).
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            In short, state is the word assigned to the current form of a thing
            assuming that the thing can change or morph into something
            different. If a thing doesn't change, it can't have state and is
            typically considered stateless. If text on a web page already loaded
            into a web browser never changes, it is stateless. Similarly, if a
            user interface never changes it is a stateless UI. However, if a
            thing like a webpage or web application, after first loading it, has
            a thing about it that changes then it has state.
          </p>

          <p>
            Specifically, in the context of webpages and web applications that
            run in a web browser local state is the data or variables that
            affects the content and form of a webpage or web application, in any
            way, during the lifetime of running it in a web browser. Let's
            unpack this a bit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider that a static website, with no HTML forms and no hidden
            content, just viewable images and text is basically a static and
            stateless thing. You enter a url to a static stateless website and
            you get exactly the thing at the url in the state that it is in and
            no data changes after that will change its state. Reload a second
            later, and you will almost certainly get the exact same thing
            unchanged. This is not unlike a written page in a book. You buy a
            physical book, you open it, and the content before you won't ever
            change. Open the book the next day and most likely the book and the
            content in the book is changeless. The book, by design, is in a
            single state and won't ever change. Unless you burn the book, but
            then you have also broken the original purpose of a book. Its
            definitely to read, not to burn.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now what if a book could change its state, based on data, in a
            real-time'ish manner? This is basically the revolutionary aspect of
            the internet and web pages. You get to interact with data that
            changes based on data in pretty much real-time. However, this means
            that data or state will have to be managed and in particular the
            changes and outcomes of data changing will have to be managed.
          </p>

          <div class="notes">
            <p>
              <strong>Keep In Mind:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Originally the world wide web was just a web of static/stateless
                documents for viewing (versioned, but pretty much though of as
                book that could be updated and shared quickly). It did not
                originate as a platform for delivering interactive user
                interfaces that managed state, especially state inputted by
                users. History just unfolded this way because the WWW platform
                became ubiquitous.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <p>
            Now, contrast a completely static stateless website like we just
            discussed to the web application you might use to do online banking.
            You open this application in a web browser and immediately the
            application wants data from you to login. It's asking for you to
            change the state of the application from not logged in, to logged
            in. The second the username or password input field goes from empty
            to containing one typed character you have change the UI state of
            the HTML input used to collect your login credentials.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you login into a banking application with your credentials the
            entire state of the application changes from a sign-in/login view to
            a logged in view. Now that the application has different data the
            application is going to now be in a different state then before.
            Because the state of logging in has change the state of what you are
            looking at has changed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generally speaking you should think of state, or maybe more
            specifically application state, as any type of data that one has to
            keep track of during a period of time a user is using a website or
            web application (aka a session). Some of this state you have to
            manually take care of. Some of it you get for free, like the fact
            that you can type characters into an HTML input and the state of the
            input changes in real-time and you have little to do with fact (i.e.
            The shadow-dom takes care of it for you).
          </p>

          <p>
            To summaries, If you deliver a webpage with a single line of text to
            a user, the webpage is pretty much state-less and static. Much like
            a physical book. However, if you sent a user a banking application
            over the internet, then that application will have states that have
            to be managed over time (e.g. logged in status, the users location
            in the application, what the account balance is, which UI is
            currently being shown and what UI parts are hidden and what UI parts
            are shown by default etc..).
          </p>

              <li>
                In the beginning state management for websites and web
                applications was mostly a backend affair. Today however, most
                web applications are either one-time-loaded single page
                application (SPA) or some hybrid version of page reloads and
                AJAX requests. Either way, as soon web pages and web
                applications get reduced to some degree of a thick/smart web
                client the runtime will have to have a mechanism to deal with
                state as it is being used/changed by the user (as opposed to a
                dumb client, that offloads state management to the backend, and
                just requests stuff and does nothing but display that stuff i.e.
                web 1.0).

          <h2>2 : State in relation to time and storage</h2>

          <section class="sub">
            <p>
              Thinking about state in an application based on life span of state
              and where it is stored and for how long.
            </p>
          </section>

          <h3>2.1 : Non-lasting state (aka ephemeral state)</h3>

          <p>
            If you enter a few characters into an HTML input on a web page you
            have change the state of the input. In fact, even focusing the input
            likely changes the state of the inputs UI from unfocused to focused.
            What happens then if the user moves to a different part of the
            website or application and then returns to the same UI. If the input
            is unfocused and the characters are gone, then this is typically
            consider non-lasting state.
          </p>

          <h3>2.1 : Short-lasting state (aka session state)</h3>

          <p>
            Short-lasting state typically has a pre-conceived end, but does not
            really fall into the category of non-lasting state. Short-lasting
            state is the type of state that the developer of a system purposely
            keeps track of for a short period of time with a known expiration
            date.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, the moment you login to a website or web application
            you have entered data that changes the state of the website or web
            application. For a limited duration of time, that logged-in state is
            stored and you remain logged into the website as you continue to
            use/change the state of the application, but a known end to the
            storage of that state has already been determined.
          </p>

          <h3>2.2 : Long lasting state (aka permanently stored state)</h3>

          <p>
            Contrasted to short lasting state long lasting state is typically
            data that is stored indefinitely until it is specifically deleted at
            a unknown time (i.e. anytime). If you enter data into a website or
            web application and that data is stored in some manner until you
            specifically (directly or indirectly) remove that data this is
            typically consider long lasting state. Long lasting state can be as
            simple as the last view/location of the UI a user was using or a
            simple set of data like drafts from a checking account. Basically,
            if you have logic, to save state for an indefinite amount of time,
            until that data is removed, it is likely long lasting state.

            3 : Organizing state by scope relevancy (i.e. what/who needs this
            state)
          </h2>

          <section class="sub">
            <p>
              The nature of state in terms of time and storage is only one facet
              of state as discussed in the previous chapter. However, another
              facet of state or way to organize it, is defining who needs access
              to it and for how long. Often, developers will divide state into
              Global state and Relative state. These catagories can be helpful
              when managing a lot of state.
            </p>
          </section>

          <h3>3.1 : Global State (aka Complex State)</h3>

          <p>
            Global state is typically, but not always long lasting state that
            needs to be accessible from every part of your application. Examples
            of global state could be session state, entity state (aka Domain or
            Data or Model or Business Logic state), communication state, and
            location state.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Session state: State about the users current interaction with the
              website or application. Typically session state can be
              short-lasting or long-lasting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Entity (aka Domain or Data or Business Logic or Model state): A
              banking apps Entity state could be the account information or
              ledger for the banking account. Typically entity state is long
              lasting state.
            </li>
            <li>
              Communication state: State concerned with communication to
              non-local content. Typically entity state can be non-lasting,
              short-lasting, or long lasting state.
            </li>
            <li>
              Location state: where the user is in the website or application
              and how the url effects the state of things the user is doing at a
              specific location. Typically location state can be short-lasting
              or long-lasting.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Global state is typically stored in global state "Stores" (e.g.
            globally accessible immutable data). Once an application requires a
            large quantity of state, with complex dependencies (X state depends
            on Y state), developers will often start to use a state manager like
            Redux or Mobx.
          </p>

          <h3>3.2 : Relative State (aka Local state or component state)</h3>

          <p>
            Relative state is called relative state because the state is not
            typically required to be accessible to the entire application and is
            likely relative or local to a part of the application but not
            typically all of it, all the time. Relative state is typically label
            as view/UI state, but it can include relative state that is
            non-lasting, short-lived, or even long lasting. Relative state is
            stored in the client as close as possible to the part(s) of the app
            that need it. That is why it is called relative, because it is
            relative to something specific. In a React application this could be
            the internal state of a component or state that is consumed from a
            close by ancestral component (aka container component or smart
            component).
          </p>

          <div class="notes">
            <p>
              <strong>Keep In Mind:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                In a React application when state reaches the top of the
                component tree in a React application, if one is practicing the
                notion of lifting state and lifting it only as high as needed,
                then one is conceding that the state is global if it reaches the
                top of the tree. At this point, the nature of the state changes
                from relative state to global state.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <p>
            The line between global state and relative state can be a very
            subjective practice. Some think about state only in terms of global
            state stores. Others think only in terms of relative state. Many
            developers advocate and will use both, based on the nature of the
            state being either global or relative.

            state)

          <section class="sub">

              What is the different between third-party state managers and
              component state?
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            Fundamentally both third-party state managers and component state
            solve similar problems, but they both have drawbacks based on the
            size of your component tree. One could use only a state manager, but
            then relative state may get shoved through its lens. One could only
            use component state but then global state may get shoved through its
            lens. Both of these situations are not ideal.
          </p>

          <p>
            State managers solve global state issues really well and side step
            prop drilling while adding boilerplate and complexity (e.g. action,
            action creator, dispatcher, reducer, store). Doing relative state
            choirs with state managers can make a really big mess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Component state solves relative state issues really well but suffers
            from prop drilling issues as state is lifted, which results in the
            use of additional patterns/API's to fix prop drilling issues
            (context, HOC, Render props etc..), which result in boilerplate and
            complexity. Doing global state choirs with component state can make
            a really big mess as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            The correct answer for a large complex application is likely a
            combination of the two types of state used wisely and accompanied by
            a concrete implementation standard so messes are minimized and
            implementation can be maintained and scaled over time. (i.e. strick,
            organized, and maintained conventions of use).

              Understanding how a state store relates to state itself.
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            State managers (e.g. Redux, Flux, or Mobx) typically store state in
            a state store. Not all state managers have the same understanding of
            a state store. But, basically, a state store is state wrapped with
            an interface (often just a pattern) for CRUD'ing state. A store is
            not state itself, a store houses the state. State managers update a
            store in very specific way so that any component/view using the
            state from a store always gets the most recent state. Some store
            managers think of state as a single store (e.g. Redux) that holds
            all state (i.e. a massive state tree) while others think of state
            existing in several different stores (i.e. Flux).

          <h2>6 : Derived or computed values from state</h2>

          <section class="sub">
            <p>
              State should only be made up of the bare minimum things that
              change over time excluding things that can be derived or computed
              from minimal state seeds.
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            A derived value is a value that is a result of other parts of state.
            For example the first name (e.g. "Pat") and last name (e.g.
            "Jenson") of a user might be actual state, but the full name (e.g.
            "Pat Jenson") is a derivation of two pieces of state. The full name
            itself is not state it is a derivation of state.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another example might the total number of completed todos in a todo
            application. This number is computed from the list of todos not
            stored as state itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Derived values are typically computed at runtime and are consider
            artifacts. Thus, derived/computed values are not typically consider
            state.
